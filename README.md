A basic First Person Shooter project made for Indiana University's MSCH-C220 by Nicholas Jager.

Most of the code and files were based off of Godot Tutorials by ZENVA, found here: https://godottutorials.pro/fps-godot-tutorial/

Modifications made by the project owner to fix runtime errors present in the tutorial. Additionally, sound effects added, and a project owner made mesh for the enemy character.
